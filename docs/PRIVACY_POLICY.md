## How safe is the data handled by Jira Assistant?
When it comes to security, first thing to clear is, Jira Assistant does not capture or store your credentials. It only captures your Jira server url provided by you and it fetches your profile information like email address, user name and timezone from Jira and store it in browsers cache. To connect to Jira server, it just uses your browsers authentication with Jira.

## What information is collected by developer from users of Jira Assistant?
Personal Information: The personal information includes just your name and email address. Such information is only collected from you if you voluntarily submit it to us through contact us forum. We do not maintain or track it through any other medium. No other information like company or jira server url is collected by developer. Only when you try to contact us, we get your email address just to responed you back. So all your personal informations are safe in your browser cache and is not sent anywhere outside of your browser by this tool.

Non-Personal Information: The Non-Personal Data includes information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, like demographic information, for example, user IP addresses, country, browser types and other anonymous statistical information that includes the use of Jira Assistant extension. From extension Google Analytics is the only medium through which we collect this data.

We use Google analytics to capture which module of the tool is being used much by users and that too only in aggregate based on country. In versions above v1.0 Google Analytics is also disabled by default and it is your wish whether to enable it on not.

Similarly we use Google Analytics to collect errors occured while using Jira Assistant. We use this error report just to identify and fix the issue. Usually this should not contain any details which is personally identifyable or your Jira server's details. But in case of http errors, if your Jira server responds with any such details, their is a possibility that, it is being sent to us. So far no such instenses were identifyed where Jira returns such details. But these error reports are not maintained longer than 3 to 6 months and after which these are deleted automatically.

**Note:** Jira Assistant or its developer is not responsible if some other malicious software installed by you captures these details from your cache. Hence it is the responsibility of users to be safe when installing softwares.

## How can I disable Google Analytics
These analytics helps us to identify the most used features and issues which helps us provide better working experience for you. But if you no longer wish to share such information with us, then you can disable it from Jira Assistant through Advance Setting page. Note: This feature is only available since Jira Assistant v1.0.

## Who has the access to your data
We do not share your personal data with any third-party in a way that reveals your personal information like email and name (subject to laws and regulations). Only Jira Assistant developers have access to these data.

## What purposes your data are used for
