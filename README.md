Earlier addon for firefox was available in the following link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jira-assistant/.

## Want to report a bug, suggest a new feature or have a question?
Please navigate to **"Issues"** tab and raise a new issue. If you do not have an account and not willing to create a new account in GitHub then you can use the below Url to do that which wont require any authentication. But I would suggest to use the Issues tab instead as it would be easy for you to have a track of the issue and see the status / updates on the issues.

Also before raising a new issue do a quick search on the issues to see if one is already available. Don't forget to view the closed issues as well which may have your queries already answered. If you find an issue which is related to your's then just do +1 for that issue with comments if any to increase the popularity, which will get immediate attention from the developers.

The most popular issues and the one with proper description and scenarios are addressed first. So don't forget to provide all the necessary descriptions / screenshots which is required by the developers to resolve it.
